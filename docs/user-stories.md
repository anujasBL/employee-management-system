## Iteration Mapping

### Iteration 1: Foundation (1.5 hours)
- User Login System
- Basic database setup
- Employee Record Management (view only)

**Deliverable**: Working authentication and basic employee viewing

### Iteration 2: Core Features (1.5 hours)
- Leave Application System
- Leave Approval System
- Employee Record Management (full CRUD)

**Deliverable**: Complete leave management workflow

### Iteration 3: Enhancement & Testing (1 hour)
- Leave Status Tracking
- Basic Dashboard
- Leave Request Notifications
- Comprehensive testing
- Deployment

**Deliverable**: Fully functional system ready for demo

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Phase 1 (0-1.5 hours)
- **Developer 1**: Backend API and authentication
- **Developer 2**: HR interface (employee viewing)
- **Developer 3**: Employee interface (leave application)

### Phase 2 (1.5-3 hours)
- **Developer 1**: Leave management backend
- **Developer 2**: HR interface (employee management + leave approval)
- **Developer 3**: Employee interface (leave status tracking)

### Phase 3 (3-4 hours)
- **Developer 1**: Notifications and final backend features
- **Developer 2 & 3**: Dashboard implementation and UI polish
- **Tester**: Comprehensive testing across all features

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers & Solutions

#### Database Setup Issues
- **Risk**: Database configuration takes too long
- **Solution**: Use SQLite for rapid development, pre-configure schema
- **Fallback**: Use in-memory storage for demo purposes

#### Authentication Complexity
- **Risk**: Role-based access control implementation delays
- **Solution**: Simple session-based authentication with hardcoded roles
- **Fallback**: Basic login without role separation

#### Frontend-Backend Integration
- **Risk**: API integration issues between teams
- **Solution**: Define API contracts upfront, use mock data initially
- **Fallback**: Hardcoded data for demo, integrate later

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing (Developer Level)
- Backend API endpoints
- Frontend component functionality
- Data validation logic

#### Integration Testing (Tester)
- End-to-end user workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance under load

#### User Acceptance Testing
- HR user workflow validation
- Employee user workflow validation
- Edge case handling

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: Express.js/Node.js or Flask/Python
- **Database**: SQLite for rapid development
- **Authentication**: Session-based with role management

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React.js or Vue.js
- **Styling**: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **State Management**: Local state or simple context

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Heroku, Vercel, or local deployment
- **Database**: SQLite file or cloud database
- **Environment**: Single environment for hackathon

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] HR users can view and manage employees
- [ ] HR users can approve leave requests
- [ ] Employees can apply for leave
- [ ] System handles authentication correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] System responds within 2 seconds
- [ ] All features work across major browsers
- [ ] System can handle 10+ concurrent users
- [ ] Deployment successful within time constraints

### Team Performance
- [ ] All developers have meaningful work throughout
- [ ] Tester can validate all user stories
- [ ] No major blockers during development
- [ ] System is demo-ready at 4-hour mark

## Notes

- **Test Early**: Implement testing alongside development
- **Deploy Often**: Aim for working software after each iteration
- **Team Balance**: Ensure all developers have parallel work
- **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate potential blockers early
- **Documentation**: Keep code simple and well-commented for rapid development
